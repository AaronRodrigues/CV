## Aaron Rodrigues

My personality has coalesced at the unlikely intersection of  two musical genres, the two being Vaporwave and Progressive Heavy Metal. After 7 Years of working for a Fortune 500 company in the oil industry, I decided to take the plunge and make a move as a Full Stack Developer. One fact that polarized this decision was that the makers of Auto-Tune, used their experience measuring waveforms in petroleum resevoirs to develop their widely used VST application .

This interest in software development was nurtured by a revisiting some of Object Oriented Programming lectures from my University days and their application to Chemical Engineering, in which I hold a degree in. I developed a desire to build things using code. This made the prospect of writing code in C# rather appealing. Working at a job building code that was readable that could save the world seemed an attractive alternative to handling a radioactive source, in a war torn country for Halliburton.

I built a basic flappy bird game among other notable arcade classics in Unity that some kids dug. 

My Favorite Question - **Why Not?**

I am currently in the trenches at Makers Academy, Europes best coding bootcamp and working calisthenics of the mind, building applications in Ruby and JavaScript. 
I hope to work in a Full Stack Developer capacity, with other like minded individuals who are enthused about clean code, Test Driven Development, stand for truth and justice, perhaps whilst picking up some more C# and C++ along the way.

#### Problem Solving

Working for Halliburton involved travelling to remote locations to run million dollar projects and have the data acquired on site sent over a VPN back to town realtime. Due to the lack of resources in these locations and logistical challenges, Problem solving was ingrained in day to day work. Working around power shutdowns, safety drills, electronic interference, troubleshooting of surface and downhole sensors were part of day to day operation.

- 7 Years experience as an Engineer in the Oil and Gas Sector
- Was directly involved in Drilling the deepest Extended Reach Wells in the Middle East

#### Critical Decision Making

Interruption of Sensor Data could involve stopping an on-site operation in order to trobleshoot. Rig costs could range between $300,000 to several million dollars per day. This loss in time could be charged back to our company if the Non-Productive-Time (NPT) was significant (usually half an hour). With only two individuals representing Halliburton on-site, one covering each shift, I was making crucial decisions that maintained a smooth operation.

- Zero Non Productive Time over a 7 Year period with Halliburton
- Trained and delegated responsibilites to juniors in my field
- Completed Competency Reports and mentored new hires
