#### Problem Solving

Working for Halliburton involved travelling to remote locations to run million dollar projects and have the data acquired on site sent over a VPN back to town realtime. Due to the lack of resources in these locations and logistical challenges, Problem solving was ingrained in day to day work. Working around power shutdowns, safety drills, electronic interference, troubleshooting of surface and downhole sensors were part of day to day operation.

- 7 Years experience as an Engineer in the Oil and Gas Sector
- Was directly involved in Drilling the deepest Extended Reach Wells in the Middle East

#### Critical Decision Making

Interruption of Sensor Data could involve stopping an on-site operation in order to trobleshoot. Rig costs could range between $300,000 to several million dollars per day. This loss in time could be charged back to our company if the Non-Productive-Time (NPT) was significant (usually half an hour). With only two individuals representing Halliburton on-site, one covering each shift, I was making crucial decisions that maintained a smooth operation.

- Zero Non Productive Time over a 7 Year period with Halliburton
- Trained and delegated responsibilites to juniors in my field
- Completed Competency Reports and mentored new hires
